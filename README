ANTLR island grammar for E4X support.

Building
========
Currently this project only supports Buildr (http://buildr.rubyforge.org/) to compile and create a jar. A few
required dependencies will be automatically downloaded before Buildr can properly install.

So to build the E4X grammar and produce a jar once Buildr installed is just:

buildr package

To see an example of use check the SimPEL language implemented in Apache ODE (http://ode.apache.org).

Enjoy!
