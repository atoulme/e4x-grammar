ANTLR island grammar for E4X support.

Building
========
Currently this project only supports Buildr (http://buildr.rubyforge.org/) to compile and create a jar. The Buildr trunk is necessary as ANTLR has only been added recently, to install it just do:

svn co http://www.intalio.org/buildr/trunk buildr
cd buildr
rake install

A few dependencies will be required before Buildr can properly install.

Building the E4X grammar and producing a jar is then just:

buildr package

Enjoy!
